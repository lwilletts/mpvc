Music player in POSIX-sh using mpv from the shell/fzf + extras/goodies [^install] üì°üõ∏üöÄ.

A fork of [lwillets/mpvc](https://github.com/lwilletts/mpvc) evolving on its own adding features such as: improved interfaces to CLI, TUI, FZF, WEB, EQZ, & play streaming services as YouTube/Invidious, with a focus on being fully programmable/scriptable from the shell.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Overview [^install]

`mpvc` is a collection of POSIX shell scripts:

- [mpvc](../../blob/master/mpvc): provides the core CLI commands to control mpv
- [extras/mpvc-tui](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-tui): provides a console TUI, using mpvc underneath
- [extras/mpvc-fzf](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-fzf): provides FZF integration to mpvc.
- [extras/mpvc-web](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-web): a hack to remotely control mpvc from web (handy on mobile)
- [extras/mpvc-mpris](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-mpris): speaks MPRIS to control mpv player through key-bindings.
- [extras/mpvc-equalizer](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-equalizer): provides a basic mpv equalizer for the CLI.
- [extras/mpvc-autostart](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-autostart): automatic mpv start/stop based on presence.
- [extras/mpvc-installer](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-installer): provides an installer to install/update mpvc.

For more details on how to use the above tools have a look at the [Git](#git) QuickStart Guide, [LogBook](#logbook).
In addition, the [casts/](#screencasts) directory to shows some screencasts of mpvc in action.

## Requirements

Required:
- `sh`: a POSIX compliant shell (`/bin/sh` works)
- `mpv`: the mpv media player (see https://mpv.io)
- `socat`: is preferred due to the differing implementations of `netcat` across UNIXes.
- `awk`: a sane version of `awk` for the same reason (GNU/BSD `awk` works)

Recommended extras:

- `curl`
- `fzf`
- `jq`
- `notify-send`
- `yt-dlp`
- `cava`

‚ö†Ô∏è Note tools **must** be up to date, in special `yt-dlp` to play streaming services, run `mpvc-installer check-reqs|config-user` to check.

## Installation

- [Git](#git)
- [Curl](#curl)
- [Debian](#debian)
- [Arch](#arch-mpvc-git)
- [BSD](#bsd)
- [MacOS](#macos)
- [Gentoo](#gentoo-mpvc)
- [Nix](#nix-mpvc)

Installing is just a matter of fetching the scripts either via [Git](#git)/[Curl](#curl)/etc., scripts can be used directly from the repo, the `mpvc-installer` bit is just there for easiness, to fetch & link them into your `BINDIR=~/bin/` that [mpvc-installer](../../blob/master/extras/mpvc-installer) does by default.

The easiest for a onetime install is using [Curl](#curl), however for @latest version a [Git](#git) install is recommended.
Remember to check your installation for missing dependencies/requirements using `mpvc-installer check-reqs`, and, if you encounter any issue file an [Issue](../../issues).

### Git

Below is a **Quick Start** guide showcasing mpvc git install and usage.
This does git clone, and symlinks the mpvc scripts to `BINDIR` (default `~/bin`), so updating becomes a matter of just running `git pull`.

```sh
 # fetch a local copy of the github repo
 git clone https://github.com/lwilletts/mpvc/
 # use extras/mpvc-installer: just copy/link to BINDIR=$HOME/bin (by default)
 (cd mpvc; extras/mpvc-installer link-user)
 (cd mpvc; extras/mpvc-installer check-reqs)
 (cd mpvc; extras/mpvc-installer config-user)
 # check ~/.config/mpvc/mpvc.conf to suit your needs

 # Running mpvc for first time can show some warnings:
 #   Warning: .config/mpvc/mpvc.conf not found, see docs/mpvc.conf
 # mpvc-installer config-user sets the default user config
 mpvc-installer config-user

 # Another common warning is when running mpvc:
 #   mpvc: Error: No files added to mpvsocket0
 # lets fix that by adding some music files to play
 mpvc

 # use mpvc to add/load/save media files or online YT URLs
 mpvc add /path/to/your/*.mp3 # or your URLs
 find . -type f -name | mpvc load
 mpvc save my-playlist

 # use mpvc stash to store/recover current mpv state (see the logbook for more)
 mpvc stash ls
 mpvc stash push current
 mpvc stash apply current

 # use mpvc-fzf to manage mpvc stash (see mpvc-fzf -h for more)
 mpvc-fzf -a
 # use mpvc-fzf to search and play youtube media
 mpvc-fzf -p 'kupla mirage'
 # use mpvc-fzf to browse & play lofi girl music (archive.org)
 mpvc-fzf -b https://archive.org/download/lofigirl-youtube/mp3/
 # use mpvc-fzf to randomly enqueue a few lofi tracks (see mpvc-fzf lofi)
 mpvc-fzf -B https://archive.org/download/lofigirl-youtube/mp3/ | shuf -n 128 | mpvc load
 # use mpvc-fzf to manage the playlist
 mpvc-fzf -f
 # use mpvc-tui to start the tui + desktop notifications
 mpvc-tui -T
```

For more  check the  [LogBook](#logbook) (remember your best chance is to try, play, and have fun).

### Curl

Fetch the mpvc-installer (written in POSIX-sh), and ensure it runs under a POSIX-sh SHELL
```console
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/lwilletts/mpvc/raw/master/extras/mpvc-installer \
  && SHELL=/bin/sh BINDIR=$HOME/bin sh ./mpvc-installer fetch-user
```

### Debian

Debian (and APT derivatives such as Ubuntu):

```console
apt install mpv gawk curl socat fzf rlwrap jq libnotify-bin # cava
```

### Arch [mpvc-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mpvc-git)

Arch (and derivatives):

```console
pacaur -y mpvc-git
pacman -Sy mpv gawk curl socat fzf rlwrap jq libnotify # cava
````

### BSD

BSD systems as OpenBSD and NetBSD using pkg_add(1) see [FAQ](../../blob/master/docs/FAQ.md):

```console
pkg_add mpv curl socat fzf rlwrap jq libnotify # mpv-mpris cava python3
```

BSD systems as FreeBSD using pkg(1) see [FAQ](../../blob/master/docs/FAQ.md):

```console
pkg install -y mpv curl socat fzf rlwrap jq libnotify # mpv-mpris cava python3
```

### MacOS

MacOS (and brew(1) based derivatives see [FAQ](../../blob/master/docs/FAQ.md)):

```console
brew install mpv curl socat fzf rlwrap jq libnotify yt-dlp # cava
```

### Gentoo [mpvc](https://gitlab.com/xy2_/osman)

```console
emerge mpvc
```

### Nix [mpvc](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/by-name/mp/mpvc/)

```console
nix-env -i mpvc
```

## Configuration

Running `mpvc-installer config-user`, just installs the default configuration files listed below under `~/.config/mpvc/`, afterwards, check and adjust them to suit your needs.

- `mpvc` configuration is performed on [docs/mpvc.conf](../../blob/master/docs/mpvc.conf).

- `mpv` configuration is performed on [docs/mpv.conf](../../blob/master/docs/mpv.conf).

- `yt-dlp` configuration is performed on [docs/yt-dlp.conf](../../blob/master/docs/yt-dlp.conf).

- `shell` aliases to type less [docs/bash_aliases.mpvc](../../blob/master/docs/bash_aliases.mpvc).

- `$TERM` configuration: A decent terminal with color/sixels support is recommended (`256color/vt340`), but outside of the scope of `mpvc` config.
